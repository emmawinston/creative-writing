# Proximity
## December 30, 2015


I’m on the number 48 bus heading east. I’m thinking about love and indifference and holding and being held, but not in the way that you think.



* * *



I sleep on your couch and half-heartedly, half-mindedly, tap out my doctoral applications while I watch you to keep you from hurting yourself or worse.


I stay with you for three days. I don’t eat. Someone has turned the volume up on my nervous system and every part of me crackles. We never touch.


I wake up with my heart racing each day for months after I leave.



* * *



Every morning I cross my fingers for change, and listen to Dean Wareham’s ‘Holding Pattern' on my bus to work.


When the letter arrives that says yes, everything you wanted is yours now, you will teach, you will write, you will learn, we believe in you, I’m surprised that I mostly feel relief.



* * *



Everything falls into place, neatly, meticulously, perfectly.


And I can’t get out of bed.


I can’t get out of bed.



* * *



I’m popping azure-blue promethazine tablets one by one out of their foil shells. I’m drinking the cheap bourbon I found on the kitchen countertop. I don’t remember what else I take.


I’m tired. I’m tired. I can’t think straight.


I’m not sure any more if I hope I won’t wake up again. I’m not sure if this is what I planned.



* * *



When I tell you you look straight through me and I drop your keys on the coffee table as I leave.



* * *



I’m thinking about holding and being held, in place. I’m thinking about being held back. I’m thinking about how two people can hurt each other by nothing more than proximity. I’m thinking about love, as a verb, as an action. I’m thinking about guarding myself in the way that I guarded you. I’m thinking about the number 48 bus heading east.
