# Rose and Crown
### November 2012


crystalline with scintillants, the houses

shade us as we tap-dance tiptoe through pooling streetlights

our laughter wrought in cumulus before us;

whisky-gilded, the city feels like Christmas

when we sense the streets heave and sigh with a misted chill

and the click-tap swish-crack as the house yawns and stretches
