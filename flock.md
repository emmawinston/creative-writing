# Flock
### Nanofiction, 8 January 2016


It was winter, and despite the cold, every night we were kept awake by the loud and insistent singing of birds. Throughout the dark hours they called to one another, a shrill symphony in the blackness.

The moment they finally fell silent we breathed a sigh of relief, but then we never heard them again.
